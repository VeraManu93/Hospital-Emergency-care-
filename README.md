# Tools

Rscript, Excel & Rstudio

# Purpose of the Dataset
This dataset is often used for data analysis, machine learning, and healthcare research, helping stakeholders understand:

1.  Emergency department usage patterns

2.  Patient demographics and conditions

3.  Resource allocation and efficiency

4.  Trends in hospital admissions

# What the Dataset Typically Includes:

1.  Patient ID (anonymized)

2.  Date and time of visit

3.  Triage level (urgency/severity)

4.  Symptoms or diagnosis

5.  Age and gender

6.  Waiting time

7.  Treatment time

8.  Outcome of the visit (e.g., discharged, admitted, referred)

9.  Hospital location or ID

# Why It’s Useful:

1.  Healthcare planning – understanding peak hours, demand for services, etc.

2.  Predictive modeling – predicting patient outcomes or overcrowding.

3.  Policy development – helping improve emergency care protocols.
